NEW Logic (v3 - LinkedIn Focus)

. LinkedIn Research Module (NEW LOGIC)
Step	Node Name	Action / Logic
4	Launch LinkedIn Scraper	PhantomBuster Node (or HTTP Request if the official node is limited). Operation: Launch Agent. Uses {{PHANTOMBUSTER_API_KEY}}. Passes linkedin_url as the input argument to your pre-configured "LinkedIn Profile Scraper" Phantom. Continue On Error: true.
5	Get Scraper Output	PhantomBuster Node. Operation: Get Output of Agent. Waits for the launched Phantom to finish and downloads the scraped JSON data (which contains bio, headline, recent posts, etc.).
6	Prepare Data for AI	Code / Function Node. Cleans the raw, nested JSON output from PhantomBuster, extracting relevant profile fields (bio, headline, recent_activity, experience) and combining them into a single clean text field: raw_profile_text.
7	LLaMA Summarizer (Profile)	HTTP Request (Groq) using {{GROQ_API_KEY}}. Prompt: Instruct LLaMA to act as a personalization researcher. It analyzes the raw_profile_text (from Step 6) and outputs a short, high-level summary of the prospect's professional focus or recent post history into the new field: linkedin_summary.
C. Icebreaker Generation and Campaign Push
Step	Node Name	Action / Logic
8	GPT-4o Icebreaker	OpenAI node using gpt-4o. Prompt: Instructs GPT-4o to act as an expert copywriter. Uses the linkedin_summary (from Step 7) and the prospect's first_name to generate a hyper-specific, conversational opener. Output is strict JSON: {"icebreaker": "..."}.
9	Append Enriched Data	Google Sheets node. Appends all data (including the new icebreaker and linkedin_summary) to the Leads_Enriched tab.
10	Send to Instantly	HTTP Request node. Pushes the lead to Instantly, mapping the icebreaker to a Custom Field for the campaign "Pet food, corporate".
11	Log Errors (Error Branch)	Google Sheets node. Collects any items that failed and appends them to the Errors_Log tab.
